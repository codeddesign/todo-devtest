# A user
- can register via email / password or-and any API at developer's decision based on experience (google, fb, twitter, ..). Use of any frameworks allowed, avoid copy-paste the "usage part"
- must confirm the code received in his mail (simulate it via logs)
- can create a team by invitation (via logs, as above).
  If a user is already registered he just needs to approve the invitation "in-app".
- can create tasks
- tasks can be asigned to one or more users

# Tasks
- have title, description, deadline
- option to mark them as completed
- tasks can optional feedback/comments
- can be removed
- can be updated
- tasks must show how long ago were added and how much time is left

# Extra
- If a user is on site and new task is added he should see the live update and maybe a small notification/info message/ special highlight/..

Hints:
- for UI as simple as possible, twitter bootstrap or anything similar is recommended
- vuejs/angular/ any other similar is recommended.
  If the developer is familiar with laravel-elixir he can use it.
  If the developer doesn't have experience with any two-way -data-binding-framework like the ones mentioned, jquery can be used.
- evaluation is based on code quality ~= way of thinking, solving the problems along the way and details that are mentioned or not.
